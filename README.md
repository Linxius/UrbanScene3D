# Capturing, Reconstructing, and Simulating: the UrbanScene3D Dataset

This is the official repository of our ECCV22 dataset UrbanScene3D. Please refer to our [project page](https://vcc.tech/UrbanScene3D) for more information.

The whole dataset can be downloaded with [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/8g2urrij2fercko/AABi0GclI-f96uYsAdP0D0Yga?dl=0), [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e91lEw56DUBbQgRTo48T3lVjo53SzEOd?usp=sharing), or [Baidu Yun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1nqurXpbMzFo_-Cmf6eheOw?pwd=7zdg).

## Simulator
All the synthetic scenes and the reconstruction of real scenes are included in the simulator.
Develop your [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/) program to play with these scenes or
install the [AirSim](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/apis/) plugin to capture your desired data.
(Airsim uses PlayerStart as the origin.)

Open UrbanScene.uproject and rebuild the project. All the scenes are located in Contents/Maps in the Content Browser.

The models of the large-scale virtual scenes are not provided due to the copyright issue and the textured meshes can not be exported from Simulator(UE). We provide [sampled points](https://github.com/Linxius/UrbanScene3D/releases/download/v0.0.1/UrbanScene3D-virtual_cities-sampled.7z) for them for evaluation purpose.

## Path format
```
image_name,x,y,z,pitch,roll,yaw
```
The provided path files in our dataset are in UE (world) coordinate system, a left-handed, Z-Up coordinate system (in cm).

Each capture of synthetic scenes comes with a path file and a captured image set. The captured images of real scenes are recorded with GPS information.

## Image capturing
For your convenience,
we provide separate image-capturing programs (in this [zip file](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/pw09ebaa6k4phzr/AABsXdqRusZp7WEtQ7qWledOa?dl=0)) for the four synthetic scenes in the benchmark. 

fov=60 resolution=6000*4000 for synthetic scenes. Real scenes come with different cameras, a camera calibration is needed to get the camera parameters accordingly.

Setup the path file and the directory of output files in `./cg_3_zuizhong/Saved/Config/WindowsNoEditor/Game.ini`:
```ini
[targectory_path]
Path=path_to_path_file

[capture_path]
Path=direcotry_of_output_images
```
and run `cg_3_zuizhong.exe` to capture images.

## Evaluation 
Please download the [compiled version](https://github.com/Linxius/UrbanScene3D/releases/download/v0.0.1/Evaluation.zip) for the evaluation on windows:x64.

```
evaluate_model.exe p1 path_to_recon p3 path_to_gt
```
p1,p3: "mesh" or "points"

The contained `.pointcloud` in real scene evaluation [data](https://github.com/Linxius/UrbanScene3D/releases/download/v0.0.1/Evaluation_data.zip) is an encrypted format for the evaluation program. Download it and unzip it to `data/`. Delete triangles that don't belong to the buildings and pre-registrate the reconstructed model with the sparse point cloud [PolyTech1k](https://github.com/Linxius/UrbanScene3D/releases/download/v0.0.1/polytech1k.ply) or [ArtSci1k](https://github.com/Linxius/UrbanScene3D/releases/download/v0.0.1/artsci1k.ply) and then:
```
evaluate_model.exe p1 path_to_recon realscene data/artsci.pointcloud
#or
evaluate_model.exe p1 path_to_recon realscene data/polytech.pointcloud
```
